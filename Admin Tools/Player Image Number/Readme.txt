Notes:

This program best works if you run it on a resoultion of 800 X 600.  

You need to have the program in the folder that conatins the player#.bmp, so you put it in either liberty.files folder or phobos.files folder.

I did this program in under an hour so it may not be perfect.

Comments and Suggestions always welecomed.

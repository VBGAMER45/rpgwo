            <P>Scihuv and I have recently purchased a dedicated server in which
		we are hosting Arcanium, Phobos, and The Arena.  Its costing some money
		so thats why you notice the changes to pages. Rpgwo.net is up and has online
		scripts for who's online and topten. Starting player plus packs and guild packs
		Also thinking about starting a web hosting business since we have all this space
		on the server.</P>

            <P>Wow after what seems like over three years Rpgwo has finally hit
            version 1.00.    What this means is that content will
            still be added but do not expect any big features to be added to the
            game.  Mickey is now working hard on another great game which
            is a mix between Rpgwo and Age of Empires.  Congratulations
            Mickey!</P>

            <P>As much as the game is nice, it just isn't worth the hassle. If

            everyone before hand that I was making it, Mickey has asked I take
            it down as a abuse of admin powers. While I agree with him in some
            regards and a large part of this request, I won't be taking it down.
            If this means I lose my admin powers, so be it. If it means I lose
            my player, so be it. I don't mind playing the game and being admin
            but as an admin there really isn't anything to do except abuse the
            powers.</P>
            <P>I am sorry to everyone I disappoint but there comes a time when

            <P>Sorry I haven't updated for such a long time. I keep getting
            wrapped up in one thing and then the next I forget about so many
            things. The good news is I have been working on getting a lot of
            updates for the site.</P>
            <P>The main one is Mickey has agreed to allow me to host all the Top
            Ten lists. However, this may not show up right away because he is
            considering adding a option for a player to opt out of ALL the lists
            for their privacy.</P>
            <P>The next big thing I have coming is, you'd have never guessed, a
            World Map. You'll be able to say 'show me sectors 3,4 to 5,5 and it
            will show you those sectors. (rectangles only, heh) This won't be up
            for at least two days because it takes about 24 hours to get a
            complete world map and then to write the code for it all the first
            time will probably take me another day.</P>
            <P>I have gathered the data on just about every NPC Monster out
            there and I will be uploading it soon, I just need to get a better
            updating method on.</P>
            <P>Also, I have decided NOT to continue the player data section
            anymore. Why? Because players are all the time changing their data
            and just catching them overloaded will tell me wrong information.
            Sorry folks but that one will probably be gone for good.</P>
            <P>Last, but certainly not least, during my use of RPGWO, I have
            made quite a few utilities to aid me in playing. One of these is a
            map overlay to show where things spawn and another is to turn a
            players maps into one big world map. I'll get them up soon as
            well.</P>
            <P>Thanks for being
      patient!</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV><BR>

            <P>I'm late in saying all this (you try getting out of a game at the
            good part) but I am, so enjoy it.</P>
            <P>The spawn time of items to monsters has been set at every 15
            minutes and monsters spawning items happens every 5 minutes.</P>
            <P>Also, Spiders sometimes drop Spider Webs which can be turned into
            Silk items. Now what the silk will be used for is another matter
            :-D</P>
            <HR>

            <P>On a different note, the Players Quest is almost done. Mickey was
            up late last night working on the rest of it. *pats Mickey on the
            back* Everyone give him a round of
      applause.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV><BR>

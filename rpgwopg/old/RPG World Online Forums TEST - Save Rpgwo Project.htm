      <DIV class=postcolor><B>Just to quickly say what this is. I wrote this to 
      UT and Mickey quite a few months back, so most of it now I really dont 
      care about. Or would not want to do. I still like the way it sounds 
      though, and I found it on my old hard drive. So I thought I would share 
      it. ;)<BR><BR>Just make sure you know I wrote this a while ago. And alot 
      of it may not still stand for what I 
      think.</B><BR><BR>----------------------------------<BR>|The RPGWO Rescue 
      Project 2003-2004|<BR>----------------------------------<BR><BR>******** 
      WARNING: CLASSIFIED INFORMATION - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! 
      ********<BR><BR>Welcome to the RPGWO Rescue Project, what is the point of 
      this project you ask?<BR>Well of course, it is to save the dying, and once 
      well made game we know as Rpgwo.<BR><BR>I think we need to start this off 
      with the obvious.<BR>Why is rpgwo dying?<BR>Well, here we go! Put on your 
      thinking caps!<BR><BR>* Rpgwo was split into 3 servers, Liberty, Phobos, 
      and Lunatik. Liberty and Lunatik were almost completely copys of 
      eachother. Accept Lunatik was supposively RP and was more l33t. Phobos was 
      also more l33t but had a different in-game system.<BR><BR>* Phobos is left 
      by Mickey to rot into nothing because he grew tired of it, the second time 
      this happened.<BR><BR>* Lunatik was opened by Mickey instead, while phobos 
      was still rotting away.<BR><BR>* Mickey also gets tired of Lunatik, and 
      instead now assigns @@@ admins with unlimited power to each server. These 
      admins are the special ed of rpgwo. Joe- Who believes he is smarter then 
      albert einstein. But his smartness is limited to turning on a blender. 
      Rhaorth- Who used her female wits to bring her to a state of unlimited 
      rpgwo power within 2 weeks of playing a game that was around for 3 
      years.(EDIT: Im really over this, but at the time I did not like you at 
      all rhaorth, so dont take it to offensively) I can also guess that others 
      may have had this @@@ power as well, not sure if Dan did. But he was just 
      never around.<BR><BR>* Community is split up over the 3 servers, and each 
      server fights it out over which is better. The community degrades into 
      CRAP.<BR><BR>* Very very foolishly UT makes the decision to have Mickey 
      make it so each server is updated differently, now each server is lacking 
      in different items and systems that one server excells in.<BR><BR>* The 
      admins take supreme rule over the servers, will not share images with 
      eachother, or scripts or any other things. They also bicker at eachother, 
      AND bicker at the players and treat no one with respect. Most newbies 
      grovel at there feet to kiss up, but the vets are usually to scared to 
      speak up.<BR><BR>Now that we have that sorted out, what is the way to save 
      rpgwo? I mean, that is the whole point of this document is it not? Well, 
      rescrew that thinking cap! Here weeeee go!<BR><BR>* First we begin to 
      create a server, this server will be the GOLDEN AGE of rpgwo. Yes, this 
      server will have everything. Towns, PK, Roleplaying, Quests. Everything 
      players will need.<BR><BR>* We wipe it all, thats right. Wipe EVERYTHING. 
      Items, monsters, scripts, uses, skills. Wipe it all! Things are so stupid 
      and out of hand it is not funny. We need to completely start over on all 
      of this. Completely. Make this a new game.<BR><BR>* Pick a setting, 
      Medieval, futuristic? Whatever, pick one and stick to it. No more toilets, 
      and guns, when we are killing goblins with swords and bows.<BR><BR>* Admin 
      development, the only admins until the servers is TOTALLY complete will be 
      the @@@ and the MOST trusted @@'s that will be on this server after 
      release. All @@'s have to be carefully chosen. @@@'s should be TWO people. 
      Each balancing out eachothers powers, @@'s should be 1-2 to start. And 
      after release possibly 3-4 to balance eachother out. @'s will be chosen in 
      time.<BR><BR>* New features! We need new features you know? One big idea I 
      have had is to have a server where the players really make a difference, 
      everytown will start out bare, with maybe one newbie merchant. BUT there 
      will be plots of brick and such with possibly a chest that you can only 
      put donations into it. Once each house or shop has enough commodities(logs 
      stone etc) and gold an admin can build it and the players can use it! 
      Thats a big thing that will get people to work together.<BR><BR>* Chosen 
      PK and arena's. We need it so that people can go PK if they choose to, BUT 
      you can go into arena's and fight without penaltys. ALSO we could possibly 
      decide instead to make it a 2x2 non-pk area. And then the harder 
      quests/monsters will be PK land. Its all decidable.<BR><BR>* Weekly 
      meetings between the admins. MANDATORY meetings that all admins must 
      attend on AIM or another service everyweek. If you do not attend, there 
      better be a good reason beforehand! Admins need to communicate with 
      eachother.<BR><BR>* Daily events! We need to have it so @ and @@'s can run 
      specialized and planned events. Keep the players happy and active! This 
      can also include sieges BUT it will not be big pit of exp anymore, we need 
      to change it somehow. Because leveling up has become that only.<BR><BR>* 
      Admins. We need to make sure there is NO, absolutely NONE, abuse of the 
      admin powers. Wether it is a @@@, @@, or @. This stuff really turns off 
      players, and is not cool.<BR><BR>These are only SOME of the things that 
      this server would need to be successfull, we would have to sincerely ask 
      mickey to try and fix the servers so that we can get 50+ 100+ 150+ even 
      people on at one time. If not this game is doomed to just die, and I dont 
      think he wants to let this waste after so long.<BR><BR>There are some 
      problems of course and things we need to do if this is to work.<BR>None of 
      the current admins can know that the rest of the servers will be wiped, at 
      least not until this server is almost finished. We cant risk losing the 
      community because they think there characters are going to be erased and 
      such. If some of the current jerks- er admins want to keep there positions 
      they can deal with being an @ or possibly if they werent to big of screw 
      ups an @@.<BR><BR>Now, to wrap this up. This is all just my idea's 
      compiled into one.<BR>I'd possibly do this if it was seriously going to 
      happen. I still have a spark for rpgwo, just in its current state it 
      really is not any fun.(EDIT: No, I no longer would work on it. But back 
      then maybe. :P)<BR>This is possible though. Rpgwo can be fun 
      again.<BR>Just depends on if theres anyone willing to take the chance and 
      try.<BR>Sacrifices need to be made for the better.<BR><BR>Hope you had fun 
      reading it, even if it doesn't happen maybe it will give you some ideas. 
      <BR>I can hope. :D

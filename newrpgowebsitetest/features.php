     <p>RPG World Online (RPGWO) is an online, persistent, massively
multi-player(50-100?), role playing game. It is written entirely in Visual Basic
and uses API for graphics and Direct Sound, well, for sound. My motto or driving
goal is to create a simulation type world with RPG gameplay, thus: "Where
simulation meets gameplay!" It is a dynamic world. Maps can be changed and
all items and such can be made and/or destroyed. An empty world
in which players can build it the way they want! </P>
<P>The world will have a plot but it will be secondary. Most RPGs are combat
oriented. I want it to even with other features. For example, a blacksmith and a
swordsman of equal level playing for 1 hour should earn the same amount of
experience.</p>

<h3>Basic features</h3>
      <p>
Combat (of course)<br>
Player improvement and development based on skills system <br>
Magic (gotta have it) <br>
Chat system (including offline messages)<br>
Land ownership <br>
Weather (rain, snow, drought, etc)<br>
Water flows (like to lower elevations and floods too!)<br>
Nature (plants and animals grow (and die!)) <br>
Trade skills (blacksmith, farm, mining, tinker, jeweler, etc)<br>
Day/night effects with lighting <br>
Dynamic plot (players affect outcome)<br>
Events (like sacking a city with monsters!)<br></p>

      <h3>Advanced features</h3>
      <p>
Government and law (magistrates and voting and war and peace)
Allegience system<br>
And much.. MUCH... more.</p>
      <p>This is in Beta version and we have a dedicated server to run it 24/7!<BR>
It is up right now for you to try.<BR>
We can use testers and just plain players to help with some feedback.</p>
